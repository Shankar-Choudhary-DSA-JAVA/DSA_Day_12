		// it is an array that can grow in size based upon requirements

		// when ever the capacity of ArrayList gets fulled the new memory will created/
		// allocated to ArrayList
		// with double the size of previous ArraLists

// but this will downgrade the performance of the ArrayList due to copy of data from one to another
		// ArrayLists because this will take time to copy the datas
		// if we attach two lists then this is called Linkedlists
		// if we add extra elem in the ArrayList the size will become double, and if we
		// remove then
		// also size of arraylist will shrink/reduces

	//Coll. fram. has some predefined classes, through which we create objects and perform some operations
	// objects prop. is called fields
		// objects behaviour/actions is called methods
		// obj = dog
		//dog.run(), dog.name()
		// through obj ref we can call fields as well as methods both
		
	// similar to Tiger , we have ArrayList class through which we can create the objects 
		//and then we can perform some operations on that objects
